    // HEADS UP! Sometimes the Clarifai Models can be down or not working as they are constantly getting updated.
    // A good way to check if the model you are using is up, is to check them on the clarifai website. For example,
    // for the Face Detect Mode: https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection
    // If that isn't working, then that means you will have to wait until their servers are back up. Another solution
    // is to use a different version of their model that works like the ones found here: https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-javascript/blob/master/src/index.js
    // so you would change from:
    // .predict(Clarifai.FACE_DETECT_MODEL, this.state.input)
    // to:
    // .predict('53e1df302c079b3db8a0a36033ed2d15', this.state.input)
